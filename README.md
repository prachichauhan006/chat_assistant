# Personal Chat Assistant (Python)

A simple command-line based personal chat assistant built using Python.  
This project demonstrates basic Python concepts such as conditional logic, dictionaries, functions, loops, and date-time handling.

## Project Overview

The Personal Chat Assistant:
- Greets the user based on the current time (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night)
- Responds to basic user questions
- Runs continuously until the user types `bye`
- Uses predefined responses and simple keyword matching

This project is ideal for beginners to understand how a basic chatbot works.

## Features

- Interactive chat in the terminal
- Predefined responses for common questions
- Graceful exit using the `bye` command
- Clean and readable Python code

## How It Works

1. The program asks for the user's name
2. It detects the current hour and prints a greeting
3. The chatbot waits for user input
4. It matches keywords from the input with predefined responses
5. If no match is found, a default learning message is shown
6. Typing `bye` ends the program
